### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

In interacting with a computer, **human input** becomes the **computerâ€™s output** and vice versa. Human input mainly occurs through the senses, while output occurs through motor controls.

#### Key Senses in HCI
The most important senses in HCI are:
- **Vision**
- **Hearing**
- **Movement**
- **Touch**

**Vision**: Visual perception can be divided into two stages:
1. Physical reception of a stimulus
2. Processing and interpretation of the stimulus

The eye functions as a mechanism for receiving light and converting it into electrical energy.

#### Memory Types
Memory has three primary functions:
- **Sensory Memory**
- **Short-Term Memory**: Activated when attention is given to sensory memories.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Formed when short-term memory is rehearsed.


### About HCI

**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** is a field concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use, as well as the study of related phenomena. The main goal is to create safe, usable systems that prioritize the user.

#### Components of HCI
1. **Human**: Can be an individual user or a group of users.
2. **Computer**: Any technology from a desktop computer to a large system.
3. **Interaction**: The direct or indirect communication between human and computer.


### Goals of HCI
- Enhance system **safety**, **utility**, **effectiveness**, **efficiency**, and **usability**.
- Create functional, safe, and user-centered systems by:
  - Understanding how people interact with technology.
  - Developing tools and techniques for creating suitable systems.
  - Fostering effective, safe interactions.
  - Prioritizing users in system design.


### Usability

**Usability** measures how effective, efficient, and satisfying a system is for users to achieve their goals. A **usable system** should be:
- Easy to use and learn
- Easy to remember
- Efficient and safe
- Enjoyable

#### Importance of Usability
1. **Good user interfaces**:
   - Increase revenue potential for a company
   - Boost user trust and loyalty
   - Improve user satisfaction
2. **Poor user interfaces**:
   - Can be frustrating and even dangerous
   - Lead to mistakes in data entry and operations
   - Make features inaccessible
   - Cause system rejection and failure


### Key Factors in HCI System Design
- **Organizational Factors**
- **Environmental Factors**
- **User Characteristics**
- **Task Requirements**
- **User Interface Design**
- **System Constraints**
- **System Functionality**
- **Productivity Considerations**


### Fields Contributing to HCI
- **Computer Science**
- **Engineering** (Ergonomics)
- **Graphic Design**
- **Technical Writing**
- **Linguistics**
- **Artificial Intelligence** (AI)


### Design in HCI
**Design** involves achieving goals within constraints (guidelines and rules). Constraints include:
- **Materials** used
- **Standards** to follow
- **Cost and Time**
- **Safety and Health** requirements

#### Affordance in Design
Affordance is the potential for an action within an environment or on an object.

Types of affordance:
- **Perceived Affordance**: Actions a user perceives as possible, which suggest how an object can be used.
- **Real Affordance**: Actions that are actually possible.

### **Mapping**
Mappings define the relationships between controls and their effects on a system.  

**Types of Mapping**  
1. **Arbitrary Mapping**  
   - Relies on labels and memory to establish the relationship between control and effect.  
2. **Paired Mapping**  
   - Offers some correlation between controls and effects but may still lead to confusion.  
3. **Full-Natural Mapping**  
   - No ambiguity; users can intuitively understand and remember the relationship without the need for labels.  

**Constraints**  
1. **Physical**  
   - Limitations imposed by physical properties or boundaries.  
2. **Semantic**  
   - Based on an individual's knowledge of the situation and the world.  
3. **Cultural**  
   - Rooted in cultural conventions and norms.  
4. **Logical**  
   - Utilizes logical relationships, such as those in natural mappings.

### **HCI Software Process**
1. **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
   - A structured process for software development.  
2. **Usability Engineering Life Cycle**  
   - Focuses on creating user-friendly systems through:  
     1. Knowing the user.  
     2. Usability benchmarks.  
     3. Goal-oriented interaction design.  
     4. Interaction design.

**Goal-Oriented Interaction Design**  
- Defines software based on the user's goals.  
- A **goal** is a final purpose, aim, or objective, while **tasks** are the specific actions taken to achieve the goal.  

**Attributes of Usability**  
- **Effectiveness**  
- **Stability**  
- **Efficiency**  
- **Memorability**  
- **Error Management**  
- **Satisfaction**  
- **Learnability**

---

### **Usability Principles**
1. Adapt usability guidelines to your specific context.  
2. Minimize the steps required to complete tasks.  
3. Clearly guide users through every step.  
4. Provide meaningful feedback, including helpful error messages.  
5. Enable users to undo actions easily.  
6. Ensure system responsiveness with appropriate response times.

### **Computer vs. Humans**
1. **Computers**:  
   - Error-free, deterministic, and sequential.  
2. **Humans**:  
   - Prone to errors, irrational, and random.  

---

### **Technology Supporting User Interfaces**
1. **Input Devices** (e.g., keyboard, mouse).  
2. **Output Devices** (e.g., monitors, speakers).  
3. **High-Speed Processing**  
4. **Networking**

---

### **Interaction Design vs. Interface Design**
- **Interface Design**: Acts as the intermediary between system code and user.  
- **Interaction Design**: Focuses on the system's functions, behavior, and presentation.

### **Usability Evaluation**
**Types of Usability Evaluation**  
1. **Exploratory**: Examines how the system is used.  
2. **Predictive**: Estimates the system's future performance.  
3. **Formative**: Focuses on improving the system.  
4. **Summative**: Measures how good the system is.  

**Methods of Usability Evaluation**  
1. **Usability Inspection**: Specialists analyze interface design.  
   - **Guideline Checking**: Comparing interfaces against detailed guidelines.  
   - **Cognitive Walkthrough**: A team tests the system as novice users.  
   - **Action Analysis**: Estimates task completion time by breaking tasks into steps.  
2. **Usability Testing**: Testing the system with real users.  
   - Necessary because intuitions can be wrong, and designers often find their own systems easy to use.  
   - **Types of Empirical Testing**:  
     - **Co-discovery**: Users collaborate while interacting with the system.  
     - **Formal Experiments**: Controlled experiments with specific variables.  
     - **Query Techniques**: Surveys or interviews to gather feedback.  
     - **Usage Studies**: Observations of how users interact with the system.

Designing for maximum usability is the ultimate goal of interaction design.  

1. **Principles of Usability**: Broad understanding of usability concepts.  
2. **Standards and Guidelines**: Provide specific directions for design.  
3. **Design Patterns**: Capture and reuse effective design solutions.  

**Types of Design Rules**

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

In interacting with a computer, **human input** becomes the **computerâ€™s output** and vice versa. Human input mainly occurs through the senses, while output occurs through motor controls.

#### Key Senses in HCI
The most important senses in HCI are:
- **Vision**
- **Hearing**
- **Movement**
- **Touch**

**Vision**: Visual perception can be divided into two stages:
1. Physical reception of a stimulus
2. Processing and interpretation of the stimulus

The eye functions as a mechanism for receiving light and converting it into electrical energy.

#### Memory Types
Memory has three primary functions:
- **Sensory Memory**
- **Short-Term Memory**: Activated when attention is given to sensory memories.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Formed when short-term memory is rehearsed.


### About HCI

**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** is a field concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use, as well as the study of related phenomena. The main goal is to create safe, usable systems that prioritize the user.

#### Components of HCI
1. **Human**: Can be an individual user or a group of users.
2. **Computer**: Any technology from a desktop computer to a large system.
3. **Interaction**: The direct or indirect communication between human and computer.


### Goals of HCI
- Enhance system **safety**, **utility**, **effectiveness**, **efficiency**, and **usability**.
- Create functional, safe, and user-centered systems by:
  - Understanding how people interact with technology.
  - Developing tools and techniques for creating suitable systems.
  - Fostering effective, safe interactions.
  - Prioritizing users in system design.


### Usability

**Usability** measures how effective, efficient, and satisfying a system is for users to achieve their goals. A **usable system** should be:
- Easy to use and learn
- Easy to remember
- Efficient and safe
- Enjoyable

#### Importance of Usability
1. **Good user interfaces**:
   - Increase revenue potential for a company
   - Boost user trust and loyalty
   - Improve user satisfaction
2. **Poor user interfaces**:
   - Can be frustrating and even dangerous
   - Lead to mistakes in data entry and operations
   - Make features inaccessible
   - Cause system rejection and failure


### Key Factors in HCI System Design
- **Organizational Factors**
- **Environmental Factors**
- **User Characteristics**
- **Task Requirements**
- **User Interface Design**
- **System Constraints**
- **System Functionality**
- **Productivity Considerations**


### Fields Contributing to HCI
- **Computer Science**
- **Engineering** (Ergonomics)
- **Graphic Design**
- **Technical Writing**
- **Linguistics**
- **Artificial Intelligence** (AI)


### Design in HCI
**Design** involves achieving goals within constraints (guidelines and rules). Constraints include:
- **Materials** used
- **Standards** to follow
- **Cost and Time**
- **Safety and Health** requirements

#### Affordance in Design
Affordance is the potential for an action within an environment or on an object.

Types of affordance:
- **Perceived Affordance**: Actions a user perceives as possible, which suggest how an object can be used.
- **Real Affordance**: Actions that are actually possible.

## Mapping
Mappings are relationships between controls and their effects on a system.

Types of mapping:
1. Abitrary mapping: relates to the use of label and memory
2. Paired mapping: confusion can still occur in paired mapping
3. Full-natural mapping: their is no ambiguity, learning and remembering. No need for labelling

Constraints:
1. Physical
2. Semantic: relies upon one's own knowledge of a situation and of the world
3. Cultural: relies upon accepting the cultural convention
4. Logical: exploits logical relationships like in natural mapping


HCI Software Process
1. System development life cycle
2. Usability engineering life cycle:
	1. Knowing the user
	2. Usability of benchmark
	3. Goal oriented interaction design
	4. Interaction design

Goal oriented interaction design: Software is determined based on the goal
A goal is a final purpose, an aim or an objective. Tasks are particular ways of accomplishing a goal

Attributes of:
- Effectiveness
- Stability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Error
- Satisfaction
- Learnability

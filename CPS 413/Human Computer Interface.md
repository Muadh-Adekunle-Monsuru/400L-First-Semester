**HCI** is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing system for human use. 

Its goal is to produce a useable, safe system and to put the user first

**Goals of HCI**:
- To produce a safe and useable system
- To produce a functional system
- To create a useable system developers need
- Achieve efficient and safe interaction
- Put users first

To develop or improve the effectiveness, safety and efficiency of a system.

Traditional software engineering:

**Factors to consider:**
- Organizational factor
- environmental factor
- the user
- tax factor
- user interface
- constraints

**Fields that contribute to HCI**
- Computer science
- Engineering: Ergonomics 
- Graphic designers
- Technical writing
- Linguistics
- AI Inclusive (LLP)

**Link to software engineering:**
- Sys, vs User
- Techniques
	- Use case
	- Iterative file cycle
- Multi-disciplinary nature of HCI

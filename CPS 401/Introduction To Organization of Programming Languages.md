Languages are classified into:
- **Natural Languages**: languages through which human being communicate with each other, eg Hausa Yoruba, English
- Machine Language: These are languages through which human being communicate with the computer. e.g. Java, Python, C++ e.tc.

 **Reasons why natural languages are complex for computers to understand:**
 1. Complexity
 2. Irregularity
 3. Uneconomical
 4. Limited means of abstraction
 5. Ambiguity


Categories of Programming Languages:
- **Machine Language:** This is the only language a computer understands, because information and data are represented using binary i.e. 0s and 1s
- **Assembly Language:** Information and data are represented using symbols and mnemonics
- **High level Language:** Computer language close to regular English language expression.

##### Translators:

These are programs that converts from other categories of programming languages to its machine language equivalent

Types of Translators:
- **Assembler**: A type of translator that would translate from assembly language to its machine language equivalent.
- **Complier**: A type of translator that would translate high-level language to its machine language equivalent  
	- **Interpreter**: An alternative to a complier.

**Stages involved in solving a programming problem:**
1. Problem definition
2. Devising a suitable method
3. Program coding using suitable programming language. 
4. Compilation and program execution
5. Debugging and testing
6. Documentation
7. Maintenance

Data are raw facts  that can be inform of:
1. **Variable**: Data that changes over time due to calculations during program's execution.
	1. Numeric Variables: variable that are made up of numbers alone. e.g. phone number
	2. Alphanumeric Variable: variable that are made up of combinations of numbers and alphabets. eg matric-no
2. Constants: These are data that are fixed and their value can not change during the execution of the program. E.g. PI: 22/7
	1. Numeric Constants
	2. Alphanumeric Constants

**Programs**
Program is a series of instructions meant to direct the computer to perform a given task. A computer program has two basic parts, operation code and the operand.

**Advantages of Machine Language:**
- Most efficient in terms of storage area usage and execution speed
- Machine language allows programmers to fully utilize the computers potential for processing data. 

**Disadvantages of machine language:**
- It is extremely tedious and time consuming 
- Instructions are difficult to remember and use because they are in 0s and 1s
- It is completely machine dependent, and programs written in machine language will execute only on the specific machine for which its written.
- Machine language is totally unstandardized unlike high-level languages.

**Advantages of Assembly Language**:
- Efficient in memory space used and processing time
- Generation of error messages that are useful in debugging 
- Support for modular programming

**Disadvantages of Assembly Language**:
- Cumbersome in usage
- Has a one-one relationship with machine language instructions and the assembly language instructions is translated to one machine language instruction which leads to long program preparation time
- It is machine dependent, leading to a substantial reprogramming when they are changes in the machine.

**Characteristics of a good programming language:**
- Clarity, simplicity and unity
- **Orthogonality**: It refers to the design principle where different operations or components can function independently without affecting each other. It means that changes or actions in one part of a system do not impact other parts. 
- Naturalness of the application
- Support for abstraction
- Ease of program verification
- Program environment
- Portability of the program
- Cost

**Simulators:** these are specialist aides that translates programs to make their coding compatible between different makes of machines. It saves the time for recording procedures.

**Emulator:** When a hardware device is used to hold the simulation program, it is known as the emulator.

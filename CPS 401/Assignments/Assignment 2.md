1. Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of high-level languages.
2. Explain each of the characteristics of a good programming language

### Advantages of High-Level Programming Languages

1. **Ease of Use**: High-level languages (HLLs) like Python, Java, and C# are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, with syntax that is closer to natural language and abstracted from the complexities of hardware.
   
2. **Portability**: Programs written in high-level languages can be run on different types of machines with minimal modifications because they are platform-independent (as long as the necessary interpreter or compiler exists for the target platform).

3. **Faster Development**: HLLs allow developers to write code more quickly due to the simplicity of the language and the availability of extensive libraries and frameworks.

4. **Abstraction from Hardware**: High-level languages handle memory management, input/output operations, and other low-level operations, allowing developers to focus on logic and functionality instead of hardware-specific details.

5. **Error Reduction**: The simpler and more readable syntax of high-level languages makes it easier to detect and correct errors during development, leading to fewer bugs in the final product.

6. **Large Community Support**: Popular high-level languages typically have vast user communities and extensive documentation, making it easier to find resources, tutorials, and solutions to common issues.

7. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: High-level languages often have advanced IDEs that provide debugging tools, code suggestions, and automation features to enhance productivity.

### Disadvantages of High-Level Programming Languages

1. **Lower Performance**: High-level languages are generally slower than low-level languages (like C or Assembly) because they require translation (through a compiler or interpreter) into machine code, which adds overhead.

2. **Less Control Over Hardware**: Due to the abstraction from hardware, developers have less control over how memory is managed or how the processor executes tasks, which can be limiting in performance-critical applications like embedded systems or real-time computing.

3. **Greater Resource Consumption**: High-level languages often use more memory and processing power because of their abstractions, which might not be suitable for systems with limited resources.

4. **Dependency on Compilers/Interpreters**: High-level programs cannot run directly on a machine's hardware and must be translated by compilers or interpreters, adding a layer of complexity in execution and deployment.

5. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Some high-level languages have built-in features (e.g., garbage collection, dynamic typing) that can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly, although this can be mitigated by following best practices.

6. **Reduced Fine-Tuning**: High-level programming languages abstract many of the low-level operations, which can limit a developer's ability to fine-tune and optimize the software for specific hardware.

### Characteristics of a Good Programming Language

1. **Clarity, Simplicity, and Unity**:  
	A programing language provides a framework for thinking about  an algorithm, it should provide a clear, simple and unified set of concepts that can be used as primitives for developing an algorithm. It is desirable to have a minimum number of different concepts with the rules of their combination being as simple and regular as possible.  
2. **Orthogonality**:  refers to the attribute of being able to combine various features of a language in all possible combination with each combination being meaningful and well defined
3. **Naturalness of the Application**:  
   A programming language needs syntax to reflect the underlining logical structure of the algorithm. It should be possible to translate such program statement that reflect the structure of the algorithm.
4. **Support for Abstraction**:  
	Abstractions refers to the act of representing essential features without including background details or explanation. The programmer may use them in other parts of a program knowing only their abstract property, without concern for the details of their implementation.
1. **Ease of Program Verification**:  
	The reliability of programs written in a particular programming language is always a central concern, their are many techniques of verifying that a program correctly performs its required function. A program may be tested by executing it with test input data and checking the output result against the specification.
1. **Program Environment**:  
	The environment in which programs are created and tested, the technical structure of programming language affects its utility. The presence of programming environment may make a weak language easier to work with than a technically stronger language. 
1. **Portability of the Program**:  
	One important criteria from many programs is its transportability from the computer for which it is developed to another computer. The language that is widely available and whose definitions are independent of the features of a particular machine forms a base for the production of transportable programs. 
1. **Cost**:  
	The ultimate total cost of programming language is the function of many of its characteristics such as, cost of training, cost of writing, cost of executing the program, cost of translation, cost of implementation and the cost of maintenance.

### What is optimization:
It is the act of obtaining the best result under any give circumstance.

In most engineering design activities the design objective could be simply to minimize the cost of production or to maximize the efficiency of production. 

For example, optimization required in designing of aircraft structures for minimum weight, finding the optimal trajectory of space vehicles, designing of civil engineering structures such as frames, bridges and obtaining the optimum designing of the control system.

#### Constraints
These represent some functional relationship among the design variables and other design parameters satisfying certain physical phenomenon and certain resource limitation.

Constraint that represent limitation on the *behavior* or *performance* of the systems are termed **behavioral** or **functional** constraints. While constraints that represent *physical* limitations on design variables such as availability, transportability are known as **geometric** or **side-constraints**. 
### Type of optimization problem:
- **Constraint optimization problem**: problems which exhibits the presence of a number of constraints 
- **Unconstrained optimization problem:** These are problems which do not involve any form of constraint

### Optimization Algorithms
- Traditional method
- Non-traditional method

##### Traditional Method
These are helpful in finding the optimum solution of continuous and differentiable functions, these methods are analytical and make use of the techniques of differential calculus. It provides a good understanding of the properties of the minimum and maximum points in a functions. An example is the Newton-Raphlson method
	
**Advantages of the traditional method:**
- The convergence to an optimal solution depends on a chosen optimal solution
- Most algorithms tend to get stuck to a suboptimal solution
- The algorithms cannot be efficiently used on parallel machine
- Algorithms are not efficient in handling problems having discrete variables
- An algorithm efficient in solving one optimization problem may not be efficient in solving a different optimization problem. 

##### Non-traditional Method
This is quite a new method with rising popularity, it involves two algorithms, namely 
- Genetic algorithm
- Simulate algorithm

Genetic algorithm vs Traditional method:
- Genetic algorithms work with the coding of the parameter set not the parameters themselves
- Genetic algorithms search from a population of points and not a single point
- Genetic algorithm uses probabilistic tradition rules and not deterministic rules
- Genetic algorithms use objective based information and not derivative or other form of auxiliary knowledge.

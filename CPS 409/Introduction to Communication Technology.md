### Basic Concepts of Communication Technology

Communication can be classified into two types:
1. *Local Communication*: Occurs over short distances.
2. *Remote Communication*: Involves long-distance communication, often called *telecommunication*. 
   - The prefix "tele-" is derived from the Greek word for "far," as seen in words like television, telegram, and telephone.

*Data* refers to any information shared in an agreed-upon format between the parties creating and using it. Data exchange occurs between two devices via a transmission medium, which can be either wired or wireless. 


 **Fundamental Characteristics of an Effective Communication System**
- **Delivery:** Data must reach the intended recipient, whether a device or user.
- **Accuracy:** Data should be transmitted without errors, as altered data may become unreliable.
- **Timeliness:** Data must arrive promptly; for instance, real-time delivery is essential for audio and video, ensuring they are received in the sequence produced without delay.
- **Jitter:** Minimizing variations in packet arrival time is crucial for maintaining quality in data streams, especially for audio and video.

- *Sender*: The source initiating the communication.
- *Message*: The content or information being sent.
- *Protocols*: A set of standardized rules that govern how communication occurs over the transmission medium, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.
- *Transmission Medium*: The channel through which the message is sent, such as coaxial cables or radio waves.
- *Receiver*: The intended recipient of the message.

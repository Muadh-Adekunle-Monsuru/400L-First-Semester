### **Question 1a: Scenario for Ordering a Sandwich via the Software Interface**

**Scenario:**  
A hotel guest wants to order a sandwich using the phone-based software agent. The guest opens the application, where they are greeted with a voice prompt or menu options. They navigate through options such as sandwich type, ingredients, and room number input. Once the order is confirmed, the robot starts preparing the sandwich. The automated delivery system then takes the completed sandwich to the guest's specified room, and a notification is sent confirming the delivery.


### **Question 1b: Heuristic Evaluation Using Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics**

Here are five positive or negative aspects of the interaction sequence:

1. **Visibility of System Status** (+) If the system provides real-time updates on the sandwich preparation and delivery status, users feel informed.
2. **Error Prevention** (-) If the user mistakenly selects the wrong sandwich type and there is no undo function, it leads to frustration.
3. **User Control and Freedom** (+) If the system allows guests to cancel or modify orders, it enhances flexibility.
4. **Match Between System and Real World** (-) If the menu uses complex, technical names for sandwiches instead of familiar ones, users may struggle to understand.
5. **Feedback and Consistency** (+) If the system confirms each step with a voice or text response, it reassures users.

### **Question 1c: Voice Recognition vs. Push Button Input**

| **Feature**        | **Voice Recognition**              | **Push Button Input**                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of Use**    | Hands-free, natural interaction    | Simple and precise selection                |
| **Accuracy**       | May struggle with accents/noise    | High accuracy with clear options            |
| **Accessibility**  | Useful for visually impaired users | Easier for users unfamiliar with voice tech |
| **Error Handling** | Might misinterpret commands        | More control over selections                |
| **Speed**          | Faster if recognized correctly     | Slower but more reliable                    |

For this situation, **push-button input** may be preferable due to accuracy and ease of use in noisy environments.

### **(a) Effect of the Abowd and Beale Model on User Intentions**

The **Abowd and Beale model** extends Norman's framework by emphasizing the **interaction cycle** between users and systems. It highlights how **user intentions** are influenced by feedback and execution mechanisms. The model ensures:

- Users **form clear intentions** based on system affordances.
- **Execution of intentions** is facilitated by intuitive interfaces.
- **Evaluation of system feedback** helps users confirm if their actions were successful.
- Improved **user experience** by reducing cognitive load and errors.

### **(b) Four Parts of the Interaction Framework**

The interaction framework consists of four key components:

1. **User** – The person interacting with the system.
2. **Input** – The mechanism through which users provide commands (e.g., keyboard, touch, voice).
3. **System** – The technology processing user input and generating responses.
4. **Output** – The feedback presented to users (e.g., screen display, sound, haptic feedback).

### **(c) General Framework for Understanding Interaction**

The general framework for understanding interaction in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** includes:

1. **Goals** – What the user wants to achieve.
2. **Execution** – How the user interacts with the system to reach the goal.
3. **Evaluation** – How the system provides feedback and allows users to assess their actions.
4. **Cognitive and Physical Constraints** – Factors affecting usability, such as memory load and response time.
5. **Iterative Improvement** – Continuous refinement based on user feedback and system evaluation.

---
![[Pasted image 20250204182830.png]]

In the context of human-computer interaction (HCI), there is a cyclical process that occurs between the user's execution of actions and the evaluation of the system's responses. Within this loop, there are seven key activities that users engage in to accomplish their objectives with the current system. 

1. Forming the Goal: The user first establishes the overarching goal they want to achieve through their interaction with the system.
2. Forming the Intention: Based on the goal, the user then develops a specific intention or plan of action to carry out.
3. Specifying the Action: The user translates their intention into the concrete steps or commands they will input into the system.
4. Executing the Action: The user physically performs the specified actions, such as clicking buttons, typing commands, or making gestures.
5. Perceiving the System State: The user observes the system's response to their actions, taking in the visual, auditory, or other feedback provided.
6. Interpreting the System State: The user makes sense of the system's state and determines whether their original intention was properly carried out.
7. Evaluating the Outcome: Finally, the user evaluates whether the end result matches their initial goal, and decides if they need to repeat the cycle with a new or modified intention.

### **Question 1**  
#### **(a) Define a notation for the state of this agent. How many distinct non-terminal states are there?**  

**Understanding the Problem**

The agent starts at position 2 (S). The goal is to reach all three positions 1, 3, and 4 (containing G1, G2, and G3 respectively). The search ends when all three goals are reached. We need to find the number of distinct *non-terminal* states. A non-terminal state is one where the agent hasn't yet reached all three goals.

**Defining the State**

The solution defines a state as a pair (P, G):

* **P:** Represents the current position of the agent (1, 2, 3, or 4).
* **G:** Represents the set of goals that have been reached so far. This can be any combination of G1, G2, and G3, including the empty set (‚àÖ) if no goals have been reached yet.

**Counting the States**

The solution uses a clever way to count the possible states:

1. **Starting Point (No Goals Reached):**
   - The agent starts at position 2, and no goals are reached (G = ‚àÖ). This gives us 1 state: (2, ‚àÖ).

2. **After Reaching G1:**
   - The agent can be at position 1 (G1 reached) or back at position 2 (still only G1 reached). 
   - So, we have 2 possible positions: 1 and 2. 
   - For each position, the reached goals are {G1}.
   - This gives us 2 states: (1, {G1}) and (2, {G1}).

3. **After Reaching G1 and G2:**
   - The agent can be at positions 1, 2, or 3. 
   - The reached goals are {G1, G2}.
   - This gives us 3 states: (1, {G1, G2}), (2, {G1, G2}), and (3, {G1, G2}).

4. **Generalizing the Pattern**
   - The solution observes a pattern:
     - When no goals are reached, there's only 1 possible position (2).
     - When G1 is reached, there are 2 possible positions (1 and 2).
     - When G1 and G2 are reached, there are 3 possible positions (1, 2, and 3).

   - This can be generalized as:
     - For reaching 0 goals, there is 1 reachable position.
     - For reaching 1 goal, there are 2 reachable positions.
     - For reaching 2 goals, there are 3 reachable positions.

5. **Calculating the Total Non-Terminal States**
   - The solution uses combinations to calculate the number of states for each stage:
     - 0 goals reached: 1 position (1 way to choose 0 goals out of 3) = 1 * 1 = 1 state
     - 1 goal reached: 2 positions (3 ways to choose 1 goal out of 3) = 2 * 3 = 6 states
     - 2 goals reached: 3 positions (3 ways to choose 2 goals out of 3) = 3 * 3 = 9 states

   - Total non-terminal states = 1 + 6 + 9 = 16

**Therefore, there are 16 distinct non-terminal states.**


#### **(b) Draw a search tree out to a depth of 3 moves, including repeated states. Circle repeated states.**  
**Understanding the Search Tree**

A search tree represents the exploration of possible paths in a problem space. In this case:

* **Nodes:** Each node in the tree represents a state (P, G), where P is the agent's position and G is the set of goals reached.
* **Branches:**  Each branch represents a move the agent makes from one position to another.
* **Depth:** The depth of the tree represents the number of moves made.

**Building the Search Tree (Depth 3)**

1. **Root Node (Start):** The root of the tree is the initial state (2, ‚àÖ) - position 2, no goals reached.

2. **Depth 1 (First Move):**
   - From position 2, the agent can move to 1, 3, or 4.
   - This leads to three branches and three new states:
     - (1, {G1}) - Moved to 1, G1 is reached.
     - (3, {G2}) - Moved to 3, G2 is reached.
     - (4, {G3}) - Moved to 4, G3 is reached.

3. **Depth 2 (Second Move):**
   - From each of the states at depth 1, the agent has new move options:
     - From (1, {G1}): Can move to 2, leading to (2, {G1}).
     - From (3, {G2}): Can move to 2, leading to (2, {G2}).
     - From (4, {G3}): Can move to 2, leading to (2, {G3}).

4. **Depth 3 (Third Move):**
   - Again, from each state at depth 2, the agent explores possible moves:
     - From (2, {G1}): Can move to 1, 3, or 4, leading to (1, {G1}), (3, {G1, G2}), (4, {G1, G3}).
     - From (2, {G2}): Can move to 1, 3, or 4, leading to (1, {G1, G2}), (3, {G2}), (4, {G2, G3}).
     - From (2, {G3}): Can move to 1, 3, or 4, leading to (1, {G1, G3}), (3, {G2, G3}), (4, {G3}).

**Identifying Repeated States**

The solution correctly identifies the following repeated states at depth 3:

* **(1, {G1})** - This state was already reached at depth 1.
* **(3, {G2})** - This state was already reached at depth 1.
* **(4, {G3})** - This state was already reached at depth 1.

**Why are these states repeated?**

The search tree shows the different *paths* to reach certain states, not just the states themselves. Even though the agent might reach the same "state" (position and goals achieved) through different sequences of moves, the search tree explicitly shows these different paths.

![[PAST QUESTIONS/405/2024_2.jpeg]]

### **Question 4**  
#### **(i) What is the CSP search algorithm?**  
A **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) search algorithm** is a method used to find solutions to problems defined by variables, domains, and constraints. The algorithm explores possible variable assignments while ensuring all constraints are satisfied. Common CSP search techniques include:  
- **Backtracking Search**: A depth-first search that assigns values and backtracks when a conflict arises.  
- **Forward Checking**: Eliminates inconsistent values from domains before assigning variables.  
- **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**: Ensures that every variable in a binary constraint has consistent values.  
- **Constraint Propagation**: Uses inference to reduce the search space.  

#### **(ii) Why is it a good heuristic to choose the variable that is most constrained but the value that is the least constraining in a CSP search?**  
Using the **Most Constrained Variable (MCV) Heuristic**, also known as the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic**, helps reduce the search space by selecting the variable with the fewest legal values first. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts and failure early.  

Choosing the **Least Constraining Value (LCV)** means selecting a value that **leaves the most options open** for future variables. This helps in **avoiding dead-ends** and increases the chances of finding a solution faster.  

This combination improves efficiency by prioritizing decisions that maximize flexibility and minimize constraint violations.  

### **Question 5**  
#### **(i) Why is Python popular, and why does it matter?**  
Python's popularity stems from several factors:

- **Ease of Learning and Use**: Its straightforward and readable syntax allows developers to express ideas with fewer lines of code, minimizing errors and debugging time.
- **Versatility**: Python is a general-purpose language used in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

**Given list:**  
```python
sample_list = [10, 20, 60, 30, 20, 40, 30, 60, 70, 80]
```
**Python Code:**  
```python
from collections import Counter

sample_list = [10, 20, 60, 30, 20, 40, 30, 60, 70, 80]
count_dict = Counter(sample_list)  

duplicates = [key for key, value in count_dict.items() if value > 1]
print(duplicates)
```
**Output:**  
```plaintext
[20, 60, 30]
```
This code uses `Counter` to count occurrences and filters items appearing more than once.


#### **(iii) Write a filter dictionary to contain keys present in the given list.**  
**Given dictionary:**  
```python
d1 = {'A': 65, 'B': 66, 'C': 67, 'D': 68, 'E': 69, 'F': 70}
l1 = ['A', 'C', 'F']
```
**Python Code:**  
```python
filtered_dict = {key: d1[key] for key in l1 if key in d1}
print(filtered_dict)
```
**Output:**  
```plaintext
{'A': 65, 'C': 67, 'F': 70}
```
This code **filters `d1`** to keep only keys present in `l1`.

**(b) An agent interacts with the environment through its body. Explain (9 marks)**

The agent's "body" refers to its physical embodiment (if it's a robot) or its interface with the environment (if it's a software agent).  This interaction is crucial:

* **Sensors:** The agent uses sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, GPS) to gather information from the environment. These sensors are the agent's "eyes and ears" on the world.
* **Actuators:** The agent uses actuators (e.g., motors, wheels, software commands) to act upon the environment. These are the agent's "hands and feet" for affecting the world.
* **Feedback Loop:**  The agent's actions change the environment, and these changes are perceived by the sensors, creating a feedback loop. This loop allows the agent to learn and adapt its actions over time.
* **Situatedness:** The agent is situated within its environment. Its actions and perceptions are grounded in the specific context it's in.


**Question 6**

**(a) An agent looks into the future in four ways; briefly explain these four ways (8 marks):**

1. **Planning:** Creating a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. This involves considering the possible consequences of different action sequences.
2. **Prediction:** Estimating what will happen in the future if certain actions are taken.
3. **Lookahead:**  Exploring possible future states to evaluate the potential outcomes of different actions.
4. **Anticipation:**  Predicting the behavior of other agents or the environment.

**(b) Explain the concept of Hierarchical Robotic System Architecture (9 marks):**

Hierarchical Robotic System Architecture organizes the control of a robot into multiple layers, each with different levels of abstraction and responsibility.  Common layers include:

1. **Reactive Layer:** The lowest layer, responsible for immediate reactions to sensory input. This layer handles basic motor control and obstacle avoidance.
2. **Deliberative Layer:** The middle layer, responsible for planning and decision-making. This layer works with higher-level goals and creates plans to achieve them.
3. **Executive Layer:** The highest layer, responsible for coordinating the reactive and deliberative layers. This layer manages the overall behavior of the robot.

**Benefits of this architecture:**

* **Modularity:** Each layer can be developed and tested independently.
* **Flexibility:**  The robot can handle both reactive and planned behaviors.
* **Robustness:**  The robot can still function even if one layer fails.
* **Efficiency:**  Different tasks can be assigned to the most appropriate layer.

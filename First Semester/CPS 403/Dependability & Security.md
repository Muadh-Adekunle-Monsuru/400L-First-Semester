### **Risk-Driven Software Development**

Any system developed should adopt a risk-driven approach to ensure the software is safe and secure. 

#### **Stages of Risk-Based Development**
1. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential risks that may arise during development or usage.
2. **Risk Analysis and Classification**: Assess the seriousness of each identified risk.
3. **Risk Decomposition**: Break down the risks to uncover their root causes.
4. **Risk Reduction Assessment**: Propose solutions to reduce or eliminate each risk.

Risk analysis should be performed at every stage of development.

### **Phases of Risk Analysis**  
*(Focuses on Stage 2: Risk Analysis and Classification)*  

1. **Preliminary Risk Analysis**:  
   - Identifies risks from the system environment and the conditions where the system will operate.  
   - Ensures the system's security settings align with its environment.  

2. **Lifecycle Risk Analysis**:  
   - Identifies risks emerging during design and development.  
   - Typically associated with the technology used for software development.  
   - Extends requirements to address and mitigate these risks.  

3. **Operational Risk Analysis**:  
   - Identifies risks arising during system operation.  
   - Focuses on user interface, user interaction, and system operators.  
   - Extends requirements to ensure users and operators are protected.

### **Reliability in Software Development**

Reliability refers to the system's attributes, including non-functional requirements, to quantify the dependability of the software.  

- Defines the number of acceptable failures during normal use.  
- Specifies the expected availability of the system.  
- Functional reliability encompasses the system's ability to **avoid**, **detect**, and **tolerate faults** during operation.  

Reliability must also consider external factors such as hardware failure and operator error.

### **Reliability Metrics**
Reliability metrics measure the reliability of the system by quantifying operational failures and correlating them to system demands and operational time.  

#### **Common Reliability Metrics**  
1. **Error Recovery Time**: The time taken to recover from errors.  
2. **System Availability**: The percentage of time the system is operational and available for use.  
3. **Rate of Failure Occurrence**: The frequency of system failures during operation.  
4. **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)**: The average time between consecutive system failures.  
5. **Probability of Failure**: The likelihood of the system failing during operation.

> A long-term measurement program is essential to evaluate the reliability of critical systems accurately.

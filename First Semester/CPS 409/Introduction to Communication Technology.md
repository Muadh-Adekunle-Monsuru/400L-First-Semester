### Basic Concepts of Communication Technology

Communication can be classified into two types:
1. *Local Communication*: Occurs over short distances.
2. *Remote Communication*: Involves long-distance communication, often called *telecommunication*. 
   - The prefix "tele-" is derived from the Greek word for "far," as seen in words like television, telegram, and telephone.

*Data* refers to any information shared in an agreed-upon format between the parties creating and using it. Data exchange occurs between two devices via a transmission medium, which can be either wired or wireless. 


 **Fundamental Characteristics of an Effective Communication System**
- **Delivery:** Data must reach the intended recipient, whether a device or user.
- **Accuracy:** Data should be transmitted without errors, as altered data may become unreliable.
- **Timeliness:** Data must arrive promptly; for instance, real-time delivery is essential for audio and video, ensuring they are received in the sequence produced without delay.
- **Jitter:** Minimizing variations in packet arrival time is crucial for maintaining quality in data streams, especially for audio and video.

**Components of data communication:**

- *Sender*: The source initiating the communication.
- *Message*: The content or information being sent.
- *Protocols*: A set of standardized rules that govern how communication occurs over the transmission medium, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.
- *Transmission Medium*: The channel through which the message is sent, such as coaxial cables or radio waves.
- *Receiver*: The intended recipient of the message.

### Data flow
**Types of Data flow**
- **Simplex**: In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional as on one way street
- **Half-duplex**: Each node/station can both transmit and receive but not at the same time
- **Full-duplex**: Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously

#### Network
This is a set of devices often referred to as nodes connected by communication link. 

A **node** can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

**A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria**:
- Performance 
- Reliability 
- Security: Protecting network devices from unauthorized access

**Types of connections**
- Point to point
- Multipoint

##### Topologies
- Bus
- Star
- Ring
- Mesh
- Tree

Protocols and Standards
It is a set of rules that governs communication, A protocol defines the what, how and where.

**Key elements of protocols**:
- Syntax: Refers to the structure or format of the data. For example, a simple protocol might expect the first 8bits to be the address of the sender, while the second 8 bits is the address of the receiver while the rest of the stream is the message itself
- Semantic
- Timing

**Standards**: These are essentials in creating and maintaining an open and competitive marl equipment. This provides guides to manufactures, vendors, government agencies to ensure the kind of interconnectivity necessary in today's market place

**Categories of standards:**
- **De facto**: By fact, which means something happens in reality or by practice, even if it's not formally recognized.  
- **De jure**: De jure is a legal term that means something is legally recognized or happens according to the law, regardless of whether it exists in reality.

Networking standard organizations:
- **ISO**: International Standard Organization
- **ITU-T**: The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication 
- **IEEE**: Institute of electrical and electronics engineer
- **EIA**: Electronics, industry association.

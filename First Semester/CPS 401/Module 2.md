#### **Syntax**
- Refers to the structure and rules of a language (e.g., C’s `if` vs. Ruby’s `if...end`).
#### **Semantics**
- Defines the meaning of a program.
- Includes both informal (prose-based) and formal (mathematics-based) descriptions.
#### **Programming Paradigms**
- **Imperative**: Procedural, state-modifying languages (e.g., C, Java).
- **Functional**: Stateless computation using recursion and function application (e.g., Haskell, OCaml).
- **Logic-Based**: Uses rules and logical inference for computation (e.g., Prolog).
- **Dynamic/Scripting**: Quick prototyping and ease of use (e.g., Python, Ruby).

#### **Compilation vs. Interpretation**
- **Compilation**: Translates source code into machine code (e.g., gcc).
- **Interpretation**: Executes source code directly (e.g., Python, Ruby).

### **5. Language Evolution**
- **Past (1950s-60s)**:
  - Focused on efficiency due to hardware constraints.
  - Included low-level features like `goto` and strict memory usage.
- **Present**:
  - Prioritizes programmer productivity.
  - Includes abstractions like encapsulation, object orientation, and scripting features.

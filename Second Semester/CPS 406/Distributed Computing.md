### **Distributed Computing â€“ Summary for Presentation**

#### **1. What is Distributed Computing?**
- A **distributed system** is a collection of independent computers working together to solve a common problem.
- Each component is located on different networked computers, collaborating through message passing.
- Inspired by natural systems (e.g., bird flocks), it has evolved with the rise of the Internet.

#### **2. Key Features**
- **No shared memory or clock**: Nodes work independently, communicate via messages.
- **Geographical distribution**: Systems can span local or wide areas.
- **Heterogeneity & Autonomy**: Different hardware/software can participate.
- **Scalability**: Resources can be added easily.

#### **3. Common Architectures**
- **Client-Server**: Clients request services; servers respond.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: All nodes are equal; share workload and resources.

#### **4. Benefits**
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient access to data and hardware.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Replication ensures availability and fault tolerance.
- **Remote Access**: Central servers provide secure data access from different locations.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Better performance-to-cost ratio than parallel systems.
- **Modular Growth**: Easy to scale and upgrade.

#### **5. Challenges**
- **Fault Tolerance**: Risk of failure increases with more nodes.
- **Synchronization**: Harder without a global clock.
- **Security**: Larger attack surface.
- **Complexity**: Design, management, and troubleshooting are more involved.

#### **6. Real-world Use Cases**
- Cloud platforms
- Scientific simulations
- AI systems
- Blockchain
- Multiplayer online games

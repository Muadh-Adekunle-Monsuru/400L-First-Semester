### **1. What is Client-Server Architecture?**

It's a system where **clients (users or devices)** request services, and **servers** provide them. Common uses include **websites, email, databases**, and **file storage**.

---

### **2. Roles**

* **Client**: Sends requests and displays results (e.g., browsers, apps).
* **Server**: Processes requests and manages resources (e.g., web servers, database servers).

---

### **3. How It Works**

1. Client sends a request (e.g., opens a webpage).
2. Server processes it (fetches data or runs logic).
3. Server sends a response.
4. Client shows the result (e.g., renders a page).

### **4. Protocols (Rules for Communication)**

* **HTTP/HTTPS** – for websites
* **FTP** – for file transfers
* **SMTP, POP3, IMAP** – for email
* **REST, SOAP** – for web services

---

### **5. Architecture Types**

* **Two-Tier**: Client ↔ Server (e.g., app ↔ database)
* **Three-Tier**: Client ↔ Application Server ↔ Database (common in web apps)
* **N-Tier**: Adds more layers (e.g., security, caching) for large systems

---

### **6. Real-World Examples**

* **Websites**: Browser (client) interacts with web and database servers
* **Email**: Email app (client) talks to mail server using email protocols
* **Mobile Apps**: App fetches data from servers and displays it

---

### **7. Key Features**

* Uses a **request-response model**
* Follows **standard communication protocols**
* Servers have **limited capacity**
* Can be targeted by **DoS attacks** (overloading the server)

---

### **8. Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer**

* **Client-Server**: Central server controls everything (more secure & manageable)
* **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: All devices are equal and share directly (used in torrents, etc.)

---

### **9. Pros and Cons**

✅ **Advantages**:

* Centralized control
* Scalable
* Easier to maintain
* Works across different platforms

❌ **Disadvantages**:

* If the server fails, the system goes down
* Needs strong network
* High setup cost
* Risk of server overload

---

### **10. Modern Trends**

* **Cloud Computing**: Servers on the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure)
* **Microservices**: Break big apps into small, independent parts for better scalability and reliability

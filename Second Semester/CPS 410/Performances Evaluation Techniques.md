These are methods used to assess the efficiency, responsiveness, scalability and the  capacity of the computer. 

Comparison of evaluation method:
These technique helps in answering critical question such as:
1. How well does the system handle its current workload
2. What will happen if the workload increases
3. Which part of the system is a performance bottleneck

Categories of Performance Evaluation:
1. **Model-based evaluation**: Involves creating an abstract representation a computer system which can be analyzed mathematically to predict system behavior. Advantage of Model Based:
	1. Fast and cost effect
	2. Good for early system design and What-If Analysis
	Limitation:
		1. Accuracy depends on assumption
		2. May not handle complex behavior.
2. **Simulation-based Evaluation:** This involves mimicking the behavior of a real or proposed system using computer programs. This approach is more flexible than analytical modelling and can handle complex interactions, mutliple-resources type and varied workloads. 
	Advantage:
		1. Very high realism
		2. Suitable for complex system with intricate logic and dependency
		3. Allow visualization of system behavior over time
	Limitations:
		4. Time consuming to develop and run
		5. Requires detailed system knowledge
		6. Result depends on input data accuracy
3. **Measurement-based Evaluation**: This technique involves directly measuring system performance under a real operating condition using monitoring rules and logs. 
	 Advantages:
	 1. Provide realistic performance data
	 2. Useful for comparing different systems or configurations
	Limitations:
	3. Expensive and time consusming
	4. Limited to current system setup
Each of the above techniques has its own strength, limitation and applications. A good performance analyst must know when and how to use each method sometimes in combination to achieve accurate and reliable results.

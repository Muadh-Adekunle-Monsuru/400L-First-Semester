### **Unit 1: Basics of Modelling and Simulation**

#### **1. Introduction**
- Human decision-making is often clouded by uncertainty and imprecision.
- **Simulation** helps in evaluating and optimizing alternatives when direct testing is impractical or expensive.
- It's especially valuable for systems with complex interactions or delayed consequences.

#### **2. Intended Learning Outcomes**
After studying this unit, students should be able to:
- Define "model" and "modelling"
- Understand when and why models are used
- Describe the modelling process
- Identify different types of models

#### **3. Main Content**

##### **Definitions**
- **Modelling:** Creating abstract representations of systems to understand or predict behavior.
- **Model:** A representation (physical, conceptual, or mathematical) of a real-world entity or process.
- **Simulation:** Using a model to study the behavior of a system over time.
- **Computer model:** A model simulated on a computer with adjustable parameters.

##### **What is Modelling and Simulation?**
- It involves understanding systems and their interactions through iterative development and testing.
- It's both a science and an artâ€”best learned by practice.

##### **Types of Models**
1. **Physical Models:** Tangible representations (e.g., model airplanes).
2. **Mathematical Models:** Use equations to describe relationships.
3. **Analogue Models:** Use physical or electrical analogs (e.g., gauges).
4. **Simulation Models:** Use sequences of random numbers to emulate real systems.
5. **Heuristic Models:** Rule-of-thumb-based, often intuitive.
6. **Deterministic Models:** Fixed inputs, no randomness.
7. **Stochastic Models:** Include variables subject to probability.

##### **Advantages of Using Models**
- Safer and cheaper than real-world testing
- Easier to control and manipulate
- Useful for training (e.g., flight simulators)

##### **Applications**
- Used in various fields from concept development to analysis and training.

##### **Modelling Procedure**
1. Examine the real-world situation.
2. Extract essential features.
3. Construct a model.
4. Solve and experiment.
5. Draw conclusions.
6. Refine if necessary.
7. Implement the model.

#### **4. Self-Assessment Questions**
- Define and differentiate between model, modelling, simulation, and computer model.
- List the steps in the modelling process.
- Explain the reasons for using models.

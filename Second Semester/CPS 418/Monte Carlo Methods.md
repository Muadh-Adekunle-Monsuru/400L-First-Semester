## **1.0 Introduction**

Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that use repeated random sampling to estimate results. They are often applied to simulate physical and mathematical systems, especially where there are numerous interacting variables.

**Use Cases Include:**

* Fluid and solid-state simulations
* Risk analysis in business
* Multidimensional integrals in mathematics
* Predicting system failures in space/oil exploration better than human intuition

---

## **2.0 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

* Describe Monte Carlo methods
* Trace the origin of the Monte Carlo method
* Identify various applications of Monte Carlo methods

## **3.0 Main Content**

### **3.1 Overview of Monte Carlo Method**

There is no single Monte Carlo method. It is a **class of algorithms** that:

* Use randomness and statistics
* Provide heuristic rather than exact results
* Assign **probability distributions** to inputs

**Typical Steps in a Monte Carlo Algorithm:**

1. Define a domain of possible inputs
2. Randomly generate inputs using a defined distribution
3. Perform deterministic computations
4. Aggregate results into a final outcome

**Example: Approximating π**

* Draw a square with an inscribed circle
* Randomly scatter grains (e.g., rice)
* Estimate π as:
    (Points inside circle / Total points) × 4

**Important Notes:**

* Accuracy improves with more samples and better randomness
* Can be viewed as **numerical integration**
* Effective even in high dimensions (does not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality")

**Mathematical Formulation (Summary):**

* Uses random vector $U$ in integration domain
* Estimate integral $\Psi$ using sample means
* Crude Monte Carlo Estimator reduces standard error as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}$
* **Variance Reduction** techniques improve efficiency

### **3.2 History of Monte Carlo Method**

* **Origin**: Developed during WWII by John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam
* **Purpose**: Solve neutron travel/shielding problems at Los Alamos Lab
* **Name Origin**: From Monte Carlo Casino (Ulam’s uncle gambled there)
* Early simulation methods were deterministic; Monte Carlo “inverts” this by **adding randomness** to deterministic problems
* Gained popularity post-1945 with advent of electronic computers
* Spurred development of **pseudorandom number generators**

### **3.3 Applications of Monte Carlo Methods**

#### **a. Physical Sciences**

* Used in physics, chemistry, and weather forecasting
* Applications: heat shield design, quantum simulations, detector modeling, galaxy simulations

#### **b. Engineering**

* Sensitivity analysis, probabilistic design, and process optimization
* Examples:
   - Microelectronics: analyze IC yield variation
   - Geostatistics: mineral processing and risk analysis

#### **c. Visual Design**

* Computes **global illumination** in photorealistic rendering (e.g., video games, architecture)

#### **d. Finance and Business**

* Value companies and investments
* Build **stochastic financial models** instead of static ones

#### **e. Telecommunications**

* Model user scenarios for network planning
* Used in **optimization of network design**

#### **f. Games**

* Applied in AI (e.g., Battleship, Go)
* Strong in strategy but may miss tactical plays
* Example: Monte Carlo Tree Search in board games

#### **g. Mathematics**

1. **Integration**
    - Works well in high-dimensional space (better than deterministic quadrature)
2. **Optimization**
    - Use random walks for function minimization
    - Applications: chess, travelling salesman, engineering design
3. **Inverse Problems**
    - Combine prior knowledge with observed data using probability distributions

### **Monte Carlo vs. “What If” Analysis**

| Monte Carlo Simulation                 | "What If" Scenarios           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Random sampling over many outcomes     | Manual input combinations     |
| Produces **probability distributions** | Produces limited outcome sets |
| More realistic and probabilistic       | Best-case/worst-case extremes |

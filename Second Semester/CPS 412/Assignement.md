**Project Title: Development of a Digital Attendance Management System**

**Overview:**
This project involves the design and implementation of a digital system for tracking student attendance in a university. The system allows lecturers to mark attendance electronically (via web or mobile), automatically generate attendance reports, and alert students who fall below the minimum attendance threshold. It also provides an admin dashboard for monitoring and analytics.

**Specific Challenges Encountered:**

1. **Unclear Requirements:**
   - At the beginning of the project, different departments had varying expectations. Some wanted biometric integration, while others preferred QR code scanning. This caused confusion and rework in the design phase.

2. **Resistance to Change:**
   - Some lecturers preferred the traditional paper-based attendance method and were reluctant to switch to a digital platform. There was fear that the system might be unreliable or too complicated.

3. **Technical Infrastructure Limitations:**
   - In some classrooms, there were issues with poor internet connectivity or lack of suitable devices (e.g., projectors, tablets) to use the system effectively, especially for real-time attendance tracking.

4. **Data Privacy Concerns:**
   - Storing student attendance records raised concerns about data protection. The team had to ensure the system complied with privacy regulations and protected sensitive information.

5. **User Authentication Challenges:**
   - Ensuring that only the rightful student marks their attendance was tricky. The team explored various options like OTP, QR code, and facial recognition, each with its own set of challenges in terms of cost, accuracy, and usability.

6. **Time Constraints:**
   - The system was expected to be ready before a new semester began. Due to delays in user testing and integration with existing student databases, the team had to work overtime to meet the deadline.

7. **Lack of Adequate Training:**
   - Some staff members were not trained in using digital tools. The absence of proper onboarding led to early complaints and misuse of the system.

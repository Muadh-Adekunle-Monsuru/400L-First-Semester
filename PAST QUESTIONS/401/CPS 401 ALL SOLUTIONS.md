### 1. Why do we need to study programming languages?
- To understand how computers execute instructions.
- To develop efficient and maintainable software.
- To improve problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
- To choose the most appropriate language for a specific application.

### 2. Briefly explain linear data structures and non-linear data structures with appropriate examples.

**Linear Data Structures:**
- Elements are arranged sequentially.
- Examples: 
  - **Array**: A list of integers `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - **Linked List**: Nodes connected in a chain.
  - **Queue**: First In, First Out (e.g., ticket booking queue).
  - **Stack**: Last In, First Out (e.g., undo operations in text editors).

**Non-Linear Data Structures:**
- Elements are not arranged sequentially.
- Examples:
  - **Tree**: Hierarchical structure (e.g., file system).
  - **Graph**: Nodes connected by edges (e.g., social networks).


### 3. Define Data Types and give the basic data types that you know with examples.

**Definition:**
- Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold.

**Basic Data Types:**
1. **Integer (int):** Holds whole numbers. Example: `5`
2. **Float:** Holds decimal numbers. Example: `3.14`
3. **Character (char):** Holds a single character. Example: `'A'`
4. **String:** Holds sequences of characters. Example: `"Hello"`
5. **Boolean:** Holds true/false values. Example: `True`

### 4. What is the relationship between data type and variable?
- A variable is a container that holds data.
- The data type defines the type of data the variable can store.
  - Example: `int x = 10;` Here, `x` is a variable of type `int`.

### 5. Define a subprogram.
- A subprogram is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a specific task within a program.
- Examples: Functions, Procedures.

### 6. What are the characteristics of a subprogram in a program?
- **Reusable:** Can be called multiple times.
- **Encapsulated:** Has its own local variables and scope.
- **Modular:** Makes the program more organized and readable.
- **Takes Inputs and Returns Outputs:** Can process data using parameters and return results.

### 7. In most languages, keywords like `begin` and `while` are reserved and may not be used as identifiers. Other languages do not have reserved keywords. What are the advantages and disadvantages of reserved words?

**Advantages:**
- Avoids ambiguity in the program.
- Makes the language syntax consistent and clear.

**Disadvantages:**
- Reduces flexibility in naming variables or identifiers.

### 8. Explain the term Garbage Collection and two (2) common approaches to garbage collection.

**Definition:**
- Garbage Collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use to free up resources for other tasks.

**Approaches:**
1. **Reference Counting:**
   - Keeps a count of references to an object.
   - Object is deleted when the reference count drops to zero.
   - Example: Python uses this approach.

2. **Mark-and-Sweep:**
   - Identifies reachable objects starting from root nodes.
   - Unreachable objects are collected as garbage.

### **Question One**
**(a) Write briefly on "APPLETS."**
- Applets are small Java programs that can run in a web browser or applet viewer.
- Typically embedded in HTML pages.
- Often used for interactive features, animations, or small applications on websites.

**(b) Write briefly on Assembly Language.**
- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides symbolic representations of machine code instructions.
- It is hardware-specific and allows direct manipulation of hardware resources.

**(c) Highlight three (3) merits of Assembly Language.**
- Efficient in memory space used and processing time
- Generation of error messages that are useful in debugging 
- Support for modular programming


**(d) Highlight three (3) demerits of Assembly Language.**
1. Difficult to learn and debug.
2. Lack of portability between different hardware architectures.
3. Requires more development time compared to high-level languages.

**(e) Explain how syntax affects the overall regularity, readability, and writability of a language.**
- **Regularity:** A consistent syntax ensures that the rules are predictable, reducing complexity.
- **Readability:** Intuitive syntax makes code easier for programmers to understand.
- **Writability:** Clear and consistent syntax allows developers to write code faster and with fewer errors.

### **Question Two**
**(a) Explain computer program and state its basic components.**
- A computer program is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do.
- **Basic Components:**
	1. Operation Code
	2. Operand

**(b) Highlight two (2) merits of Machine Language.**
- Most efficient in terms of storage area usage and execution speed
- Machine language allows programmers to fully utilize the computers potential for processing data.

**(c) Highlight four (4) demerits of Machine Language.**
- It is extremely tedious and time consuming 
- Instructions are difficult to remember and use because they are in 0s and 1s
- It is completely machine dependent, and programs written in machine language will execute only on the specific machine for which its written.
- Machine language is totally unstandardized unlike high-level languages.

**(d) Describe an abnormal condition that arises in a code sequence at runtime.**
- **Runtime Error:** Occurs when a program executes an illegal operation, such as division by zero, accessing invalid memory, or type mismatch.
### **Question Three**
**(a) What makes a good programming language acceptable?**
- Clarity, simplicity and unity
- Orthogonality 
- Naturalness of the application
- Support for abstraction
- Ease of program verification
- Program environment
- Portability of the program
- Cost

**(b) Differentiate between constant and variable.**
- **Constant:** A fixed value that does not change during program execution. Example: `PI = 3.14`.
- **Variable:** A memory location whose value can change during program execution. Example: `x = 5`.

### **Question Four**
**(a) Write briefly on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).**
- OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects that contain both data and methods.
- Promotes modularity, code reusability, and abstraction.

**(b) Explain the concepts a programming language must support before it can be considered to be object-based.**
1. **Encapsulation:** Combining data and methods within objects.
2. **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details from users.
3. **Inheritance:** Reusing properties and methods of a parent class in a child class.
4. **Polymorphism:** Using a single interface to represent multiple types.

### **Question Five**
**(a) Write briefly on "Classes" in programming.**
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP, defining their attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).

**(b) Classes programming can have several different forms of responsibility. Explain each.**
1. **Data Encapsulation:** Organizing related data and methods.
2. **Reusability:** Creating reusable components.
3. **Inheritance:** Facilitating code reuse by extending existing classes.
4. **Polymorphism:** Allowing methods to behave differently based on object types.

**(c) What do you understand by Translator?**
- A translator converts code written in one programming language into another.
- Types: Compiler, Interpreter, Assembler.

### **Question Six**
**(a) Write briefly on "Messages" in programming.**
- Messages are a mechanism in OOP where objects communicate by calling each otherâ€™s methods.

**(b) Highlight and discuss each of the three (3) categories of messages in programming.**
1. **Synchronous Messages:** Sender waits for a response.
2. **Asynchronous Messages:** Sender continues without waiting.
3. **Broadcast Messages:** Sent to multiple objects simultaneously.

**(c) Substantiate with reasons why natural languages are complex for computers to understand.**
 1. Complexity
 2. Irregularity
 3. Uneconomical
 4. Limited means of abstraction
 5. Ambiguity

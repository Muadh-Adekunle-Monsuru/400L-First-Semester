**1. Expert Systems**

* **What they are:** Computer programs designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains.
* **How they work:** They rely on a knowledge base (facts, rules, heuristics) gathered from human experts and use an inference engine to apply this knowledge to solve new problems.
* **Examples:** Medical diagnosis systems, financial advisors, fault detection systems.
* **Strengths:** Can handle complex problems in well-defined areas, provide explanations for their reasoning.
* **Limitations:**  Can be difficult and time-consuming to build, knowledge may be incomplete or become outdated.

**2. Machine Learning**

* **What it is:**  A type of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
* **How it works:**  Algorithms identify patterns and relationships in data, building models that can make predictions or decisions on new data.
* **Types:** Supervised learning (labeled data), unsupervised learning (unlabeled data), reinforcement learning (learning from feedback).
* **Examples:** Image recognition, spam filtering, fraud detection, recommendation systems.
* **Strengths:**  Can adapt and improve over time, can handle large and complex datasets.
* **Limitations:** Can be prone to bias based on training data, may require significant computational resources.

**3. Neural Networks**

* **What they are:** A subset of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
* **How they work:** Networks of interconnected nodes (neurons) process and transmit information, learning by adjusting the strength of connections.
* **Types:** Feedforward networks, convolutional networks (CNNs for images), recurrent networks (RNNs for sequences).
* **Examples:**  Natural language processing, image generation, speech recognition, machine translation.
* **Strengths:**  Excellent at pattern recognition, can handle complex and high-dimensional data.
* **Limitations:** Often require large datasets, can be computationally expensive to train, interpretability of models can be challenging.

**4. Cognitive Modeling**

* **What it is:**  The simulation of human cognitive processes (e.g., thinking, problem-solving, memory, language) using computer models.
* **Goals:**  To understand how the human mind works, develop AI systems that think more like humans, and create tools for studying cognitive disorders.
* **Approaches:** Symbolic modeling (using rules and symbols), connectionist modeling (using neural networks), hybrid approaches.
* **Examples:**  Models of attention, memory retrieval, decision-making under uncertainty.
* **Strengths:** Provides insights into human cognition, can potentially lead to more human-like AI.
* **Limitations:** The complexity of the human mind makes complete modeling very difficult, models are often simplifications.

**5. Robotics**

* **What it is:** The design, construction, operation, and application of robots. In AI, the focus is on creating robots with intelligent behavior.
* **Key Components:**  Sensors (to perceive the environment), actuators (to move and interact), control systems (to process information and make decisions).
* **Applications:** Manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, service industries.
* **Challenges:** Robust perception and navigation in real-world environments, safe and ethical human-robot interaction.

**6. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

* **What it is:**  Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
* **Core Components:**
    * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Handles the technical aspects of working with text data (tokenization, parsing, etc.).
    * **NLU:** Focuses on the deeper understanding of meaning, intent, and sentiment in language.
* **Applications:**  Chatbots, virtual assistants, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization.
* **Challenges:** Ambiguity and complexity of human language, constantly evolving nature of language.

**7. Production Systems**

* **What they are:** Rule-based AI systems that use a set of production rules to represent knowledge and solve problems.
* **How they work:**
    * **Production Rules:** IF (condition) THEN (action)
    * **Working Memory:** Stores information about the current state.
* **Examples:**  Expert systems, business process automation, early AI game-playing systems. 
* **Strengths:**  Can be relatively easy to understand and implement, modularity of rules.
* **Limitations:** Can become difficult to manage for complex problems, may not handle uncertainty well.

**8. Planning and Acting**

* **What it is:** The ability of an AI agent to set goals, create plans to achieve those goals, and execute those plans in a dynamic environment.
* **Key Concepts:** 
    * **States:**  Representations of the environment at different points in time.
    * **Actions:**  Operations an agent can perform to change the state.
    * **Goals:** Desired states the agent wants to achieve.
    * **Plans:** Sequences of actions to achieve goals.
* **Applications:** Robotics, autonomous systems, game AI.
* **Challenges:** Dealing with uncertainty and incomplete information, planning in complex and changing environments.

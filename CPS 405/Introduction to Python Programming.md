## 6. Core Python Concepts

### Python Identifiers
an identifier is a name used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or any other user-defined objects.
 **Rules for naming variables and functions**:
- **Valid Character**: can contain letters, digits, and underscores. They must start with a letter or an underscore
- **Case Sensitivity**: Python identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning "variable" and "Variable" are treated as different identifiers
- **Reserved Words:** e.g. if, else, while, for
- **Length Limitation:** no specific limit on the length of an identifier.

### Indexing in Python
indexing is the process of accessing individual elements within a data structure, such as a string or a list, using a numerical index. In python, the indexing is zero-based, which means the first element has an index of 0
Types of indexing:
a) Positive Indexing
b) Negative Indexing

### Python Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators
	- **Addition**: `+`
	- **Subtraction**: `-`
	- **Multiplication**: `*`
	- **Division**: `/`
	- **Floor Division**: `//`

	- **Exponentiation**: `**`
2. Comparison (Relational) Operators

	- **Logical AND**: `and`
	- **Logical OR**: `or`
	- **Logical NOT**: `not`
4. Assignment Operators

### Type Casting
- Also known as type conversion
- Converting one data type to another:
  - Examples: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`.
- Useful for operations and comparisons between different data types.

### Immutability and Collection Data Types in Python

In Python, immutability refers to the property of objects that cannot be modified after they are created. When an immutable object is altered, a new object with the desired changes is created instead of modifying the original object.

 Examples of Immutable Objects
1. **Numbers**: Includes integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
2. **Strings**
3. **Tuples**

 Key Points about Immutability
1. Data Integrity
	- Immutable objects ensure that their values remain constant throughout the program.
	- This prevents inadvertent changes to the associated data, preserving reliability.
2. Creation of New Objects
	- Operations that seem to modify immutable objects (e.g., string concatenation or adding elements to a tuple) result in the creation of a new object.
	- The original object remains unchanged, which helps maintain data consistency.
3. Hashability
	- Immutable objects are generally hashable, allowing them to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.
	- Their unchanging nature ensures a constant hash value, enabling efficient storage and retrieval in hash-based structures.
4. Memory Efficiency
	- Python can optimize memory usage by reusing immutable objects.
	- For instance, multiple variables assigned the same string value will reference the same memory location, reducing memory consumption.

Difference Between Mutable and Immutable Objects
- **Mutable objects**: Can be modified after creation (e.g., lists and dictionaries).
- **Immutable objects**: Cannot be altered, requiring the creation of new objects for changes.

**Importance of Immutability**
Understanding immutability is crucial in Python as it influences:
- **Object handling**: Ensures stability and integrity of data.
- **Function arguments**: Prevents unintentional side effects.
- **Variable assignments**: Facilitates predictable behavior.
- **Data structures**: Aids in creating reliable and efficient programs.

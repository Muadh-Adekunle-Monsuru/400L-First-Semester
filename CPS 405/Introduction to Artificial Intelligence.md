**Artificial Intelligence:**
It is the art of creating a machine that performs human functions that requires knowledge and intelligence. 

**Importance of Artificial Intelligence:**
- **Search**: It provides a way of solving problems for which no more approach is available, as well as a framework into which any other direct technique that are available can be embedded and used. 
- **Use of knowledge:** AI provides a way of solving complex problems by exploiting the structure of the objects in which they are involved. 
- **Abstraction:** AI provides a way of separating important features and variations from the many unimportant ones that will otherwise overwhelm any process.

**Classification of Artificial Intelligence:**
- **AI tools**: Comprises of computer languages, models, database, management, decisions theory and cognitive programming. 
- **Learning & Induction**: Includes heuristics, strategy to solve problems, reasoning and inferences. Most techniques used for developing AI falls into learning an induction category 
- **Perception & Data Acquisition:** It comprises of the knowledge of visual and sound recognition by computer device.
- **Robotics:** These are machines that imitates human beings and can recognize objects, manipulates then and are usually mobile. 
- **Understanding & Communications:** This include knowledge, understanding written and oral languages. It also includes the act of learning and translation. 
- **Problem-solving & model building**: This class comprises of generation of solutions, analysis, searching and decision making.

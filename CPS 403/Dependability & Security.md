Identify the risk associated with the software. Any system developed should be risk-driven, this approach ensures software is safe and secure. 

Stages of risk based development 
- Risk Identification: identify potential risk that may arise
- Risk Analysis and classification: assess the seriousness of each risk
- Risk Decomposing: Decompose it to know the root cause
- Risk reduction assessment: Solutions to reduce or eliminate each of the risks

Risk analysis should be performed at each stage of development

Phases of Risk Analysis (stage 2 in risk-):
- Preliminary risk analysis: Identifies risks from the system environment, risks of where the system will be run. Set system security
- Lifecycle Risk Analysis: identify the risk that can emerge during design and development, these risks are usually associated with the technology used for software development. Exetends requirement to cater 
- Operational risk analysis: Risk that emerge during the operation of the system, usually associated with the user of the system, user interface and its operators. Extend the requirement and ensure they are protected 

## Reliability
Reliability will mention the system attributes like none functional requirements so as to quantify the reliability of the software development. Defines the number of failures that are acceptible during the normal use of the system or number of times which the system must be available. 
Functional reliability of the system define the system and the functions that avoid, detect and tolerate faults when the system is operating. 

Include hardware failure, operator error. 

**Reliability metrics**:
Reliability metrics are units of measurement of system reliability.
System reliability is measured by counting the number of operational failures and, where appropriate, relating these to the demands made on the system and the time it takes the system to respond to it and the time that the system has been operational.
A long-term measurement programme is required to assess the reliability of critical systems.

Reliability Metrics:
- Error recovery time
- System availability
- Rate of failure occurance
- Mean time to failure 
- Probability of failure

Software is a group of programs working together to perform a specific task.

Software engineering is concerned with the theories, methods, techniques and tools of producing cost effective software which meets the needs of the end-users (stakeholder)

Why: The economy of all developed nation are all developed on software. More and more systems are software controlled i.e (course registration, payment). The expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of the GNP (Gross National Product). Software cost often dominate computer system cost. 

Software can be divided into:
- **Generic Products:** Standalone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them. Also know as off-the-shelf software. E.g. Photoshop. The specification of what the software will do is owned by the developer.
- **Customized Product**: Tailor made products, software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own specific needs. e.g. Embedded control system, air-traffic software system, traffic monitoring system, result computation. Bespoke. The specification of what the software will do and look like is owned by the customer. 

Attributes of a good software system:
1. Cost-effective 
2. Maintainable
3. Dependable  
4. Reliable
5. **Useable**: easy to navigate and use by the user. 
6. Security
7. Acceptability 

Key challenges facing software developer:
1. Increasing diversity, multiple language.
2. Staff retention: Keeping software engineer is costly

**Software process**: is a set of structured activities required to develop a working software system.

**Key components of software development:**
- **Specification**: defining what the system should do
- **Design and implementation**: Defining the organazation of the system and implementation of the system
- **Testing**: testing and validating the system built, and to make sure it meets the requirements of the specification.
- **Evolution**: Software deployment, changing the system in response to changing customers needs. 

**Model**: A representation of an abstract entity, simplified representation of a complex system or idea, it is an abstraction that helps to understand, analyze and predict the outcome of a phenomenon.

**Type of models**:
- **Physical Model**: a representation of objects or system. e.g architectural model of a building or estate
- **Mathematical Model**: represented inform of equations or algorithms. 
- **Conceptual models**: representation of ideas or concepts.
- Simulation model
- **Statistical model:** Data driven representation of patterns and trends

**Benefits of models:**
- **Insights**: Models provide understanding of complex system.
- **Efficiency**: Models streamline analysis of decision making
- **Accuracy:** Models improve prediction and forecasting
- **Innovation**: Models facilitate experimentation and scenario planning
- **Communication**: models facilitates knowledge sharing

**Software process model:** Software process model is an abstract representation of a process for developing a software. This represents a description of a process from some particular perspective. It includes the product, the roles of stakeholder, and the pre and post conditions.

**Types of process models:**
1. **Plan-driven model:** are processes where all the process activities are planned in advanced and progress is measured against this plan
	1.  Waterfall model
	2. Reusable components model
	3. Spiral model
1. **Agile Model**: Planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirement
	Variants of Agile:
	1. Scrum
	2. Extreme programming
	3. Kanban
There is no such thing as a good or bad model, in practice we have a fusion of process models.

Software is a group of programs working together to perform a specific task.

Software engineering is concerned with the theories, methods, techniques and tools of producing cost effective software which meets the needs of the end-users (stakeholder)

Why: The economy of all developed nation are all developed on software. More and more systems are software controlled i.e (course registration, payment). The expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of the GNP (Gross National Product). Software cost often dominate computer system cost. 

Software can be divided into:
- **Generic Products:** Standalone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them. Also know as off-the-shelf software. E.g. Photoshop. The specification of what the software will do is owned by the developer.
- **Customized Product**: Tailor made products, software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own specific needs. e.g. Embedded control system, air-traffic software system, traffic monitoring system, result computation. Bespoke. The specification of what the software will do and look like is owned by the customer. 

Attributes of a good software system:
1. Cost-effective 
2. Maintainable
3. Dependable  
4. Reliable
5. **Useable**: easy to navigate and use by the user. 
6. Security
7. Acceptability 

Key challenges facing software developer:
1. Increasing diversity, multiple language.
2. Staff retention: Keeping software engineer is costly

**Software process**: is a set of structured activities required to develop a working software system.

**Key components of software development:**
- **Specification**: defining what the system should do
- **Design and implementation**: Defining the organazation of the system and implementation of the system
- **Testing**: testing and validating the system built, and to make sure it meets the requirements of the specification.
- **Evolution**: Software deployment, changing the system in response to changing customers needs. 

**Model**: A representation of an abstract entity, simplified representation of a complex system or idea, it is an abstraction that helps to understand, analyze and predict the outcome of a phenomenon.

**Type of models**:
- **Physical Model**: a representation of objects or system. e.g architectural model of a building or estate
- **Mathematical Model**: represented inform of equations or algorithms. 
- **Conceptual models**: representation of ideas or concepts.
- Simulation model
- **Statistical model:** Data driven representation of patterns and trends

**Benefits of models:**
- **Insights**: Models provide understanding of complex system.
- **Efficiency**: Models streamline analysis of decision making
- **Accuracy:** Models improve prediction and forecasting
- **Innovation**: Models facilitate experimentation and scenario planning
- **Communication**: models facilitates knowledge sharing

**Software process model:** Software process model is an abstract representation of a process for developing a software. This represents a description of a process from some particular perspective. It includes the product, the roles of stakeholder, and the pre and post conditions.

**Types of process models:**
1. **Plan-driven model:** are processes where all the process activities are planned in advanced and progress is measured against this plan
	1.  Waterfall model
	2. Reusable components model
	3. Spiral model
1. **Agile Model**: Planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirement
	Variants of Agile:
	1. Scrum
	2. Extreme programming
	3. Kanban
There is no such thing as a good or bad model, in practice we have a fusion of process models.

**Waterfall Model**
Waterfall Model: often used in building large complex systems. It is a linear sequential approach to software development. Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.

- Specification
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing/Validation
- Integration & Deployment

**Tools used in specification:**
- Context diagram
- Architectural diagram
- Dataflow diagram
- Sequence diagram

Validation is checking if the program performs the action the user intended while verification is to ensure all expectations can be handled by the system

**Features of Waterfall Model**
- Linear progression
- Predictive: Project plan is fixed with clear deadline and deliverables.  
- Sequential

**Advantages of waterfall manage**:
- Easy to manage: A linear progression makes it easy to manage and track progress
- Clear deadline: the predictive nature of waterfall model provides a clear deadline.
- Well defined requirements
- Less risky
- Flexibility: Processes can be broken down and assigned to different teams to work on. 

**Disadvantages:**
- Inflexibility: The linear progression makes is difficult to accommodate changes in requirements 
- High risk of project failure: If requirement are not well defined
- Long development cycle
- Difficulty in accommodating changes

**Situations to use waterfall**
- Fixed deadline
- When all requirements are gathered
- Low risk project

**What will make it fail**
- Insufficient project requirement
- Poor project design
- Inadequate testing
- Lack of flexibility to add to changes

**Incremental Design Model**
After initiation all other phases are interleaved. This model allows amendments to be made at each phase

**Incremental development benefits**:
- The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced
- It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done.
- More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible

**Incremental development problems**:
- The process is not visible: Managers need regular deliverables to measure progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce documents that reflect every version of the system. 
- System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. 

**When will incremental design approach be suitable**:
- User isnt certain about the requirement

## Reusable Component Model

This is based on systematic reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or COTS(Commercial-off-the-shelf) systems.

**Process stages:**
- Requirements specification
- Component analysis
- Requirements modification
- System design with reuse
- Development and integration
- System Validation

**Types of software component**:
- Web services that are developed according to service standards and which are available for remote invocation. 
- Collections of objects that are developed as a package to be integrated with a component framework such as .NET or J2EE.
- Stand-alone software systems (COTS) that are configured for use in a particular environment.


## Specification

This is the process of establishing what services are required and the constraints on the system's operation and development.

**Process of requirement engineering (specification):**
- **Feasibility study**: Is it technically and financially feasible
- **Requirements elicitation and analysis**: what exactly do the system stakeholders require or expect from the system.
- **Requirements specification**: Defining the requirements in detail
- **Requirements validation**: Checking the validity of the requirement. 

![[Pasted image 20241104150826.png]]

**Software design**: This is the process of converting the system specification into an executable system. 

**Implementation:** Translate this structure into an executable program;

**functional requirements** define what the system should do. They specify the core functionality and features of a system, describing the tasks it must perform. Examples include user authentication, data processing, and reporting.

**Non-functional requirements** define how the system should perform those tasks. These are quality attributes, like performance, scalability, usability, reliability, and security, which influence the system's operational standards.

difference between context diagram and architectural diagram.

|              | Context Diagram                                                                                                                           | Architectural Diagram                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Shows the system's interaction with external entities (like users, other systems, or data sources) but does not go into internal details. | Provides a detailed view of the systemâ€™s internal structure and components, including how they interact with each other.    |
| Focus        | Only on high-level relationships, data flow, and the boundaries of the system.                                                            | Internal organization of the system, including layers, components, modules, databases, servers, and network configurations. |
| Detail Level | High-level, providing a broad overview of inputs and outputs.                                                                             | More detailed than a context diagram, often technical, aimed at developers and engineers.                                   |
| Usage        | Useful for stakeholders who need to understand the system's overall context without technical detail.                                     | Used for technical planning and development, showing how components work together within the system.                        |


In summary, a context diagram is more about the external perspective (what interacts with the system), while an architectural diagram dives into the internal workings and structure of the system.
